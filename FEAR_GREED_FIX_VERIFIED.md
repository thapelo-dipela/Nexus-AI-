# ✅ Fear & Greed API Fix - Verified Implementation

**Status:** FIXED AND VERIFIED  
**Date:** April 11, 2026  
**Issue:** `module 'config' has no attribute 'FEAR_GREED_API'` error during training

---

## Issue Summary

During cycle execution, the training loop failed with:
```
[dim]Fear & Greed fetch failed: module 'config' has no attribute 'FEAR_GREED_API'[/dim]
```

## Root Cause

The config constant was renamed from `FEAR_GREED_API` to `FEAR_GREED_URL` during the sentiment API migration, but one reference in `main.py` was missed.

## Solution Applied

**File:** `/path/to/user/Desktop/NEXUS TRADING AI/main.py`  
**Line:** 465  

**Changed:**
```python
response = requests.get(config.FEAR_GREED_API, timeout=5)
```

**To:**
```python
response = requests.get(config.FEAR_GREED_URL, timeout=5)
```

## Verification Performed

### ✅ File System Verification
- Line 465 of main.py confirmed contains: `config.FEAR_GREED_URL`
- Config.py line 64 confirmed contains: `FEAR_GREED_URL = "https://api.alternative.me/fng/?limit=1"`
- Grep search confirmed no remaining `config.FEAR_GREED_API` references in Python code
- Syntax check: `python3 -m py_compile main.py` passed

### ✅ Runtime Verification
- Fresh Python import test: `FEAR_GREED_URL` constant successfully imported
- API connectivity test: Fear & Greed Index API responsive (current value: 15)
- Main module imports successfully without "missing attribute" error
- System ping test passed: PRISM connectivity verified

### ✅ Cache Clearing
- Removed all `__pycache__` directories
- Removed all `.pyc` bytecode files
- Ran with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` flag to prevent new cache creation

---

## Status

**The fix is complete and verified.** The training loop is now ready to fetch Fear & Greed data without errors.

The error message shown in previous cycle output was from the stale/cached version before the fix was applied. With fresh bytecode (cache cleared), the system now correctly uses `config.FEAR_GREED_URL`.

---

## Next Steps

Run the training loop again:
```bash
python3 main.py --dry-run -v
```

The Fear & Greed fetch should now complete successfully without errors.
