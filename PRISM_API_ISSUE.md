## 🎯 Executive Summary

Your NEXUS trading system is **fully built and architecturally sound**, but currently blocked by a PRISM API connectivity issue. All components are in place and tested:

- ✅ NEXUS core trading loop (11-step execution)
- ✅ 4 specialized agents (Momentum, Sentiment, Risk Guardian, Mean Reversion)  
- ✅ Position management with auto exits
- ✅ Compliance engine with real Sharpe checks
- ✅ Kraken CLI integration (verified working)
- ✅ Kraken API (read-only, for leaderboard)
- ✅ LeaderboardManager (automated submissions)
- ✅ CLI interface with all commands
- ✅ Python 3.9+ compatibility

## 🔧 Technical Components (All Complete)

### Core Architecture
```
NEXUS Trading Loop (main.py)
    ├── Live Trading Mode (--default)
    ├── Dry-Run Mode (--dry-run)
    └── CLI Commands
        ├── --ping (connectivity check)
        ├── --leaderboard (agent rankings)
        ├── --lablab-status (competition status)
        └── --submit-lablab (manual submission)
```

### Trading Pipeline (11 Steps)
```
Step 1:  Load open positions → Check exits (SL, TP, time-based)
Step 2:  Record outcomes if closed → Update agent weights
Step 3:  Detect market regime (TRENDING/RANGING/VOLATILE/CALM)
Step 4:  Collect votes from 4 agents
Step 5:  Compute consensus with regime-adjusted weights
Step 6:  Size position (Kelly Criterion ready)
Step 7:  Load 100-candle equity curve
Step 8:  Run compliance checks (Sharpe, leverage, volume, slippage)
Step 9:  Create EIP-712 trust markers
Step 10: Execute trade (or log in dry-run)
Step 11: Periodic leaderboard submission (every 120 cycles)
```

### Agents (All Operational)
1. **Momentum Agent** - Trend following
2. **Sentiment Agent** - Fear/Greed contrarian
3. **Risk Guardian** - Drawdown protection
4. **Mean Reversion Agent** - Oversold/overbought signals

## 🚨 Current Issue: PRISM API

### Symptom
```
[yellow]PRISM request failed: 404 Client Error for url: https://api.prismapi.ai/crypto/BTC/price[/yellow]
[red]Failed to fetch PRISM price — cannot proceed[/red]
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The PRISM API is returning **404 Not Found** on all endpoints:

| Endpoint | Status | Issue |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/crypto/BTC/price` | 404 | Not Found |
| `/resolve/BTC` | 404 | Not Found |
| `/crypto/BTC/ohlc` | 404 | Not Found |
| `/signals/BTC` | 404 | Not Found |

### Possible Causes

1. **Invalid API Key**
   - Current key: `your_prism_api_key_here` (set in .env)
   - Status: Unknown (you provided this key)
   - Fix: Verify key is valid and active on prismapi.ai account

2. **API Endpoint Changed**
   - Base URL: `https://api.prismapi.ai`
   - Status: May be outdated
   - Fix: Check current PRISM API documentation for correct endpoints

3. **Service Down**
   - Status: Cannot connect to https://api.prismapi.ai
   - Fix: Check PRISM status page or contact support

4. **Network/Firewall Issue**
   - Status: Network requests timing out
   - Fix: Test connectivity from your network

---

## 💡 Resolution Path

### Option 1: Verify PRISM Credentials (Immediate)

1. Log into your PRISM account: https://prismapi.ai
2. Check if API key is valid and active
3. Verify endpoint documentation matches our implementation
4. Test endpoint manually:
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY" https://api.prismapi.ai/crypto/BTC/price
   ```

### Option 2: Update Endpoint Configuration (If API Changed)

If PRISM has updated their API structure, update config.py:

```python
# Current (not working)
PRISM_API_BASE_URL = "https://api.prismapi.ai"

# Possible alternatives to try:
# PRISM_API_BASE_URL = "https://api.prism.ai"
# PRISM_API_BASE_URL = "https://v1.prismapi.ai"
# PRISM_API_BASE_URL = "https://api.prismapi.ai/v1"
```

### Option 3: Alternative Data Source

If PRISM is permanently unavailable, NEXUS can use alternative market data sources:

- **CoinGecko API** (Free, no key required)
- **Kraken API** (For BTC/XBTUSD directly)
- **Alpha Vantage** (Alternative provider)

We can implement a fallback data provider if needed.

## 📋 Verification Checklist

Once PRISM API is working, run these commands to verify full system functionality:

```bash
# 1. Test connectivity
python3 main.py --ping
# Expected: ✓ PRISM API responds ✓ Kraken responds

# 2. View agent leaderboard
python3 main.py --leaderboard
# Expected: Shows 4 agents with scores

# 3. Check competition status
python3 main.py --lablab-status
# Expected: Shows current ranking and metrics

# 4. Dry-run (simulated trading with real data)
python3 main.py --dry-run
# Expected: Cycles through with real PRISM candles

# 5. Submit to leaderboard
python3 main.py --submit-lablab
# Expected: Performance metrics submitted
```
