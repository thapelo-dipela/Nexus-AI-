## 📊 What to Watch For

### Sentiment Logs (Verify 4 sources are live)
Look for lines like:
```
[dim]Fear/Greed: 65/100 → signal=+0.30[/dim]
[dim]CoinGecko trending: BTC #4 → signal=-0.10[/dim]
[dim]CoinGecko community: up=55.0% → signal=+0.10[/dim]
[dim]Messari 24h change: +2.50% → signal=+0.25[/dim]
[dim]Sentiment blend (fear_greed, trending, community, messari_momentum): +0.488[/dim]
```

✅ All 4 sources shown = Multi-source system working  
⚠️ Some sources missing = Single source failed (graceful fallback active)  
❌ No sentiment logs = fetch_composite_sentiment() not being called

### Weight Updates (Training feedback loop active)
Look for lines like:
```
[bold cyan]Weights updated[/bold cyan] — win $2.50 for momentum, loss $1.00 for sentiment
```

✅ Weights changing = Learning is happening  
⚠️ Weights stuck at 1.0 = Bug: record_outcome() not called (training broken)

### Risk Veto Messages
```
risk_guardian: VETO (risk_score=80.0 >= 75.0 threshold)
```

✅ Occasional veto = Working as designed  
⚠️ Every cycle = Market too volatile, trading disabled  
❌ No veto = Risk assessment broken

---

## 🎯 Training Timeline

| Time | Expected Activity |
|------|-------------------|
| 0-5 min | System startup, first cycle |
| 5-30 min | First trades opening/closing, weights start changing |
| 30 min - 4 hours | Agent divergence becomes visible (some weights > 1.05, others < 0.95) |
| 4-24 hours | Significant weight spread (winners 1.1+, losers 0.9-) |
| 24-72 hours | Market regime changes, agents re-weight dynamically |

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Fear/Greed fetch failed"
- One source failed (acceptable)
- If ALL sources fail: check internet connection

### "Weights stuck at 1.0"
- Bug: `record_outcome()` not being called when positions close
- **Solution:** This was fixed. Check main.py lines 195-220 have the training step.

### "Risk score always 100"
- PRISM API not returning volatility data
- Check: `python3 main.py --ping` to verify connectivity

### "No trades opening"
- Normal if market is neutral or risk is high
- Check logs for "HOLD" consensus or risk veto

---

## 📈 Success Metrics (After 24-48 hours)

- ✅ **Weights diverged**: Some agents > 1.05, others < 0.95
- ✅ **Trades closed**: At least 5-10 positions closed (monitored in nexus_weights.json)
- ✅ **PnL recorded**: nexus_weights.json shows non-zero win/loss counts
- ✅ **No CryptoPanic errors**: Logs clean of "News sentiment fetch failed"
- ✅ **Sentiment blend active**: All 4 sources visible in logs

---

## 📁 Key Files to Monitor

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `nexus_weights.json` | Agent reputation tracking | Each trade close |
| `positions.json` | Open positions | Real-time |
| `.log` (if enabled) | System logs | Every cycle |
| `submissions.json` | Performance history | Each cycle |

---

## 🛑 Graceful Shutdown

When ready to stop:
```bash
Ctrl+C
```

System will:
1. Save current positions to `positions.json`
2. Record final state in `nexus_weights.json`
3. Exit cleanly

Resume training later by running `python3 main.py --dry-run -v` again.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Training runs in `--dry-run` mode (no live Kraken execution)
- Each cycle: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- Market data: Live from PRISM API (verified at startup)
- Sentiment: 4 free APIs, multi-source blend
- Consensus: Reputation-weighted agent voting
- Risk: 75.0 risk_score threshold (blocks trades)
