## 🔧 Quick Reference

### The Fix (One-Liner)
Added `consensus_engine.record_outcome()` call to exit block in `main.py`.

**Result:** Agent weights now update dynamically on every trade close.

### Start Training (Copy-Paste)
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd "/path/to/user/Desktop/NEXUS TRADING AI"
python3 main.py --dry-run -v

# Terminal 2
python3 training_monitor.py

# Terminal 3 (check anytime)
python3 -c "import json; w=json.load(open('nexus_weights.json')); print('\\n'.join(f\"{r['agent_id']:20} w={r['weight']:.3f}  W/L={r['wins']}/{r['losses']}\" for r in w))"
```

### Expected Results

| Time | Status | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **30 min** | Training started | Monitor |
| **2 hours** | Weights diverging | Check hourly |
| **8 hours** | Clear winner | Verify PnL |
| **24 hours** | Ready to evaluate | Decide: live or continue |

## 📊 Key Metrics to Watch

### During Training
- **Weight spread** — Should grow from 0.98–1.02 to 0.5–1.8+
- **Winner emergence** — One agent should hit >1.2 around 8 hours
- **Accuracy convergence** — Winner should hit >50% win rate
- **PnL trajectory** — Should move from ±$5 to ±$500+ per day

### Before Going Live
- ✅ Winner weight > 1.3
- ✅ Winner accuracy > 50%
- ✅ Total PnL positive
- ✅ Weights stable (no wild swings)

### Red Flags (Stay in Training)
- ❌ Weights stuck at 1.0 (no trades closing)
- ❌ All agents retiring (too many losses)
- ❌ Negative PnL consistently
- ❌ Weights jumping erratically
