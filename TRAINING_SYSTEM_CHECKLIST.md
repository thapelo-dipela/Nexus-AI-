## What Was Fixed

### Before Fix ❌
```
Trade closes → PnL recorded → on-chain signed
                           ✗ Weights NEVER updated
                           ✗ Training loop BROKEN
```

### After Fix ✅
```
Trade closes → PnL recorded → weights UPDATED → on-chain signed
             → Agent votes → reputation ENGINE → consensus learns
```

---

## How to Verify the Fix Works

### Test 1: Run Dry-Loop (Easiest)
```bash
cd "/path/to/user/Desktop/NEXUS TRADING AI"
timeout 600 python3 main.py --dry-run -v 2>&1 | grep "Weights updated"
```

Expected: See `[bold cyan]Weights updated[/bold cyan]` after first position closes (5–10 min).

### Test 2: Watch Live Leaderboard
```bash
# Terminal 1
python3 main.py --dry-run -v

# Terminal 2
watch -n 5 'python3 -c "import json; w=json.load(open(\"nexus_weights.json\")); print(\"\\n\".join(f\"{r[\"agent_id\"]:20} w={r[\"weight\"]:.3f}  W/L={r[\"wins\"]}/{r[\"losses\"]}\" for r in w))"'
```

Expected: Weights change over time (not stuck at 1.0).

### Test 3: Full Dry-Run Training (24 hours)
```bash
python3 main.py --dry-run -v &
python3 training_monitor.py
```

Expected: Clear winner agent after 8–24 hours with >50% accuracy.

## Documented Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Healthy Training
```
momentum             w=1.450  W/L=12/5   acc=71%
sentiment            w=1.200  W/L=10/6   acc=63%
risk_guardian        w=0.850  W/L=6/9    acc=40%
mean_reversion       w=0.700  W/L=4/10   acc=29%
```
✅ Clear ranking, ready for live consideration

### Scenario 2: Problem: Weights Stuck
```
momentum             w=1.001  W/L=0/0    acc=0%
sentiment            w=1.000  W/L=0/0    acc=0%
risk_guardian        w=1.002  W/L=0/0    acc=0%
mean_reversion       w=1.000  W/L=0/0    acc=0%
```
❌ No trades closed or no outcomes recorded → check logs for `Weights updated`

### Scenario 3: Problem: All Retiring
```
momentum             w=0.100  W/L=2/8    acc=20%  [RETIRED]
sentiment            w=0.100  W/L=1/9    acc=10%  [RETIRED]
```
❌ Consensus too poor → adjust thresholds or position sizing

## Quick Commands Reference

### Launch Training
```bash
cd "/path/to/user/Desktop/NEXUS TRADING AI"
python3 main.py --dry-run -v
```

### Monitor Dashboard
```bash
python3 training_monitor.py
```

### Check Weights (One-Liner)
```bash
python3 -c "import json; w=json.load(open('nexus_weights.json')); print('\\n'.join(f\"{r['agent_id']:20} w={r['weight']:.3f}  W/L={r['wins']}/{r['losses']}  pnl={r['pnl_total']:+.2f}\" for r in w))"
```

### Reset Training (Fresh Start)
```bash
rm nexus_weights.json nexus_equity_curve.json nexus_positions.json
python3 main.py --dry-run -v
```

### Check Connectivity
```bash
python3 main.py --ping
```

## Training Timeline Reference

| Time | Expected | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0–30 min** | Positions opening, weights ~1.0 | Monitor position flow |
| **30 min–2 hrs** | First exits, weights diverging | Check leaderboard |
| **2–8 hrs** | Clear winner (w>1.2), clear loser (w<0.8) | Verify PnL positive |
| **8–24 hrs** | Stable ranking, ready for live | Decide: live or continue |

---

## Decision Tree: When to Go Live

```
Is winner weight > 1.3?
├─ NO → Continue training (wait longer)
└─ YES → Are wins > losses?
    ├─ NO → Adjust thresholds (continue dry-run)
    └─ YES → Is total PnL positive?
        ├─ NO → Fix agent quality (continue training)
        └─ YES → Are weights stable (last 10 trades)?
            ├─ NO → Market too volatile (continue dry-run)
            └─ YES → ✅ READY FOR LIVE TRADING
```

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Agent Reputation
- **Weight** — Normalized influence (0.1–5.0, target: 1.0+ for winner)
- **Accuracy %** — Win rate in rolling 20-trade window
- **W/L Ratio** — Total wins vs. total losses
- **PnL Total** — Cumulative USD profit/loss

### System Health
- **Total PnL** — Sum of all agent contributions
- **ROI %** — Return on initial capital
- **Closed Positions** — Number of trades that hit TP/SL
- **Active Agents** — Non-retired agents still voting

### Training Progress
- **Hours Elapsed** — Time since training started
- **Cycles** — Number of full voting loops completed
- **Convergence** — Distance between highest/lowest agent weights

### Short-Term (Next 2 Hours)
- [ ] Watch for `[bold cyan]Weights updated[/bold cyan]` in logs
- [ ] Check leaderboard using quick command
- [ ] Verify positions are opening and closing

### Medium-Term (2–8 Hours)

- [ ] Identify winning agent (weight > 1.2)

### Long-Term (8–24 Hours)
- [ ] Leaderboard should show clear ranking
- [ ] Winner has 50%+ accuracy
- [ ] Total PnL positive or very close
- [ ] Make go-live decision

### After Training (When Ready)
- [ ] Switch from `--dry-run` to live

## Common Questions Answered

**Q: How long does training take?**  
A: 8–24 hours for a clear winner. Can be faster with higher volatility or larger positions.

**Q: Why aren't weights updating?**  
A: Check that positions are closing (hitting TP/SL). Takes time if trades are small or market slow.

**Q: Can I train on multiple symbols?**  
A: Not yet. One symbol at a time. Change `config.PRISM_SYMBOL = "ETH"` to switch.

**Q: Should I go live after 24 hours?**  
A: Only if winner has >50% accuracy, total PnL is positive, and weights are stable.

**Q: Can I reset and retrain?**  
A: Yes: `rm nexus_weights.json && python3 main.py --dry-run -v`

**Q: What if all agents retire?**  
A: Consensus is poor. Increase CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD or STOP_LOSS_PCT and retrain.
